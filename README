supported R12 entities:
-----------------------
 * ARC
 * ATTDEF
 * ATTRIB
 * BLOCK
 * CIRCLE
 * 3DFACE
 * INSERT
 * LINE
 * POINT
 * POLYLINE (special Polyface and Polymesh objects are available)
 * SHAPE (not tested)
 * SOLID
 * TRACE
 * TEXT
 * VERTEX (only for internal use, see Polyline, Polyface and Polymesh objects)

not supported R12 entities:
---------------------------
 * DIMENSION

Buildup entities:
-----------------
Build with basic R12 DXF-entities.
 * MText
 * LinearDimension
 * AngularDimension
 * ArcDimension
 * RadialDimension
 * Table (like a HTML table)

Native DXF dimensions are not supported, because I don't know how this works,
hints are welcome.

My first goal was to support newer DXF-Versions as R12, because R12 is well
supported by SDXF (stani). But this trail ends with the result that AutoCAD
crashes on opening the dxf drawings (error messages were useless). So I decided
to stay at DXF R12, and there are not enough usefull new DXF-Entities since R13
to waste my time for supporting newer DXF versions. The most interesting objects
like solid models are binary encoded and not documented by Autodesk.
My focus now lies in creating composite elements like MText, Table and various
dimension lines.

Missing from R13 and later:
  * MTEXT (R13) ... emulated as MText buildup
  * ELLIPSE (R13) ... approximated by POLYLINE
  * SPLINE (R13) ... approximated by POLYLINE
  * LWPOLYLINE ... POLYLINE
  * BODY, REGION, 3DSOLID (R13) binary encoded and not documented
  * IMAGE, HATCH, MLINE, TOLERANCE, LEADER, XLINE, RAY (R13)
  * OLEFRAME and PROXY entities (R13)
  * WIPEOUT (R2000)
  * TABLE (R2005) ... emulated as Table buildup
  * HELIX, LIGHT, MLEADER, SECTION, UNDERLAY (R2008)
  * SURFACE (R2008) binary encoded and not documented
  * SUN (R2009)
  * SUBDIVISION (R2010)
