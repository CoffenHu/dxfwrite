Abstract
========
A Python library to create DXF R12 drawings.

a simple example::

    from dxfwrite import DXFEngine as dxf
    drawing = dxf.drawing('test.dxf')
    drawing.add(dxf.line((0, 0), (10, 0), color=7))
    drawing.add_layer('TEXTLAYER', color=2)
    drawing.add(dxf.text('Test', insert=(0, 0.2), layer='TEXTLAYER')
    drawing.save()

supported DXF R12 entities
--------------------------
 * ARC
 * ATTDEF
 * ATTRIB
 * BLOCK
 * CIRCLE
 * 3DFACE
 * INSERT
 * LINE
 * POINT
 * POLYLINE (special Polyface and Polymesh objects are available)
 * SHAPE (not tested)
 * SOLID
 * TRACE
 * TEXT
 * VERTEX (only for internal use, see Polyline, Polyface and Polymesh objects)

not supported DXF R12 entities
------------------------------
 * DIMENSION

emulated entities from DXF R13 and later
----------------------------------------
 * MTEXT (R13) ... emulated as composite entity MText
 * ELLIPSE (R13) ... approximated by Ellipse (as POLYLINE)
 * SPLINE (R13) ... approximated by Spline (as POLYLINE)
 * LWPOLYLINE (R13) ... use POLYLINE
 * TABLE (R2005) ... emulated as composite entity Table

composite entities
------------------
consisting of basic R12 DXF-entities.
 * MText
 * LinearDimension
 * AngularDimension
 * ArcDimension
 * RadialDimension
 * Table (like a HTML table)
 * Ellipse (as POLYLINE)
 * Spline (cubic spline curve as POLYLINE)
 * Bezier (cubic bezier curve as POLYLINE)
 * Clothoid (Euler spiral as POLYLINE)

Installation
