dxfwrite.py is a library to create DXF R12 drawings.

Supported R12 Entities:
  * ARC
  * ATTDEF
  * ATTRIB
  * BLOCK
  * CIRCLE
  * 3DFACE
  * INSERT
  * LINE
  * POINT
  * POLYLINE (special Polyface and Polymesh objects are available)
  * SHAPE (not tested)
  * SOLID
  * TEXT
  * VERTEX (only interal used)
not supported R13 Entities:
  * TRACE (???)

Buildups Entities: (build with basic R12 DXF-entities)
  * MText
  * DimsionLine
  * DimensionAngle
  * DimensionArc
  * DimensionRadius

Native DXF dimensions are not supported, because i don't know how this works, hints are welcome.

My first Goal was to support newer DXF-Versions because R12 is well supported by SDXF (stani).
But this try ends at the point where AutoCAD crashes on opening the dxf drawings, and
the error messages were meaningless for me.
And there are not enough usefull new DXF-Entities since R13 to waste my time for supporting
DXF R13 or newer. The most interesting objects like solid models are binary encoded and
not documented by Autodesk.

Missing from R13 and later:
  * MTEXT (R13) ... emulated as buildup
  * ELLIPSE (R13) ... approximated by POLYLINE
  * SPLINE (R13) ... approximated by POLYLINE
  * LWPOLYLINE ... POLYLINE
  * BODY, REGION, 3DSOLID (R13) binary encoded and not documented
  * IMAGE, HATCH, MLINE, TOLERANCE, LEADER, XLINE, RAY (R13)
  * OLEFRAME and PROXY entities (R13)
  * WIPEOUT (R2000)
  * TABLE (R2005)
  * HELIX, LIGHT, MLEADER, SECTION, UNDERLAY (R2008)
  * SURFACE (R2008) binary encoded and not documented
  * SUN (R2009)
  * SUBDIVISION (R2010)
