.. _ARC:

ARC
===

Type: Basic DXF R12 entity.

Draws circular arcs â€” arcs cut from circles, not from ellipses,
parabolas, or some other complicated curve, the arc goes from start angle
to end angle.

.. method:: DXFEngine.arc(radius=1.0, center=(0., 0.), startangle=0., endangle=360., **kwargs)

    :param float radius: arc radius
    :param center: center point (xy- or xyz-tuple), z-axis is 0 by default
    :param float startangle: start angle in degree
    :param float endangle: end angle in degree

Attribs of DXF entities can be changed by the index operator::

  from dxfwrite import DXFEngine as dxf

  drawing = dxf.drawing('drawing.dxf')
  arc = dxf.arc(2.0, (1.0, 1.0), 30, 90)
  arc['layer'] = 'points'
  arc['color'] = 7
  arc['center'] = (2, 3, 7) # int or float
  arc['radius'] = 3.5
  drawing.add(arc)
  drawing.save()
