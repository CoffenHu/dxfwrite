Paper space (Layout)

Model space and paper space units
---------------------------------

I always use the same units for model space and paper space, and because I am not an
experienced AutoCAD user, I don't know if it is possible to choose different units in
model space and paper space. For example: in model space 1 drawing unit = 1 meter, the
paper space units are also in meters, so the paper space area of the DIN A0 paper format
is 1.189 x 0.841 (meter/drawing units).
